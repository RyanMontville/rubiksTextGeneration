# Rubiks Text Generation
I like Rubik's Cubes. My average time to solve a 3X3 is about a minute. I wanted to explore creating Rubik's Cube mosaics, so I purchased 100 "Magic Cubes" for 12 cents each. Whenever I want to add text to a mosaic, I stuggle to get the letters and spacing correct, so I created this program to help me generate the text.

The program runs on Python and uses the Pillow library to generate an image guide of the text in the mosaic. The program is customizable to adapt to any size mosaic you want. It starts by asking how many cubes and the configuration of the cubes in the mosaic. Then it will ask what the background color of the mosaic will be, then the text color. After the user inputs the text, it generates the text, centering it in the mosaic.
